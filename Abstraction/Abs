Abstraction-->
By using the Abstraction We can hiding the Implementation of application and Showing the functionlity of the
application is known as Abstraction.
*->By using the Abstraction class we can achive 0 to 100 percent Abstraction
and by Using the Interface we can achive 100 percent of Abstraction.

Advantages of abstraction 
Reduces complexity
Avoid code duplication 
Ease the burden of maintenance
Increase security and confidentiality 

Interfaces-->
Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.

An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:
